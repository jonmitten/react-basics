# react-basics
Based on Team Treehouse React Basics course

## Getting started
A web server is required to run this project locally. The server can be any server you like. I prefer node's http-server, which is easy to deploy and since node is required, easy to install.

`npm install -g http-server`

If you don't yet have node.js installed locally, you can [follow these instructions](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/install-node-js-npm-mac)

### Clone the repository to your local development environment. 

This assumes your local development environment is located at /Users/<your user name>/Development/tutorials/react but you can establish your working directory anywhere.

```
cd ~/Development/tutorials/react/tth-react-basics
git clone https://github.com/jonmitten/react-basics tth-react-basics
```

### Start local webserver

```
http-server -p 5054
http://127.0.0.1:5054/
```
